                <p></br></p>
                <h3>Application for Enrolment</h3>
                <ol class="list-style order-lower-alpha">
                <li>A student desirous of being enrolled in the Senior Division shall apply to the Officer Commanding of the nearest NCC Unit; while a student desirous of being enrolled in the Junior Division should apply to the Headmaster/Principal of the school in the prescribed form.</li>
                <li>There is provision for students desirous of enrolling in NCC even from educational institutions that are not enlisted as NCC sub-units. In this provision of ‘Open Category’, the student needs to approach the Commanding Officer of the nearest NCC Unit for further guidance. The students can thus avail NCC training from institutions that are already NCC sub-units, subject to following conditions:-</li>
                <ol class="list-style order-lower-roman">
                <li>The educational institution in which the student is studying should not be having NCC.</li>
                <li>The educational institution in which the student is desirous of undergoing NCC training should be placed under an NCC unit that has been declared an “Open Unit” by the Competent Authority.</li>
                </ol>
                <p></br></p>
                <p>This scheme assists in extending Senior Division/Senior Wing coverage to those 10+2 schools which have only Junior Division functioning in those schools and Senior Division unit cannot be allotted due to some reason or the other. Further, it lends an opportunity to those certificate holders, who wish to obtain ‘B’ and ‘C’ certificates and do not have NCC in their colleges.</p>
                <h3>Application for Enrollment:-</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>A student desirous of being enrolled in the Senior Division shall apply to the Officer commanding the unit.</li>

The Commanding Officer or the Headmaster may make such further enquiry regarding the suitability of the applicant for enrolment in the unit or part thereof in which he desires to be enrolled, as may be prescribed in this behalf, by the State Government.</p>
                <h3>Medical Examination</h3>
                <p>If the Commanding Officer or the Headmaster is satisfied that the application is in order, and that the applicant fulfils the conditions of enrolment and that he is suitable for enrolment in the unit or part thereof in which he desires to be enrolled, he shall cause the applicant to be medically examined.<br />
                If the Commanding Officer or the Headmaster is not satisfied that the application is in order or that the applicant fulfils the conditions of enrolment or that he is suitable to be enrolled in the unit or part thereof or the applicant is reported to be medically unfit for service in the National Cadet Corps, the Commanding Officer or the Headmaster shall reject the application and shall inform the applicant accordingly.</p>
                <h3>Method of Enrollment-</h3>
